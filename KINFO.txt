The General Structure is this:

boot/:
	Manages Protected mode boot and moving into long mode.
	Jumps to the kernel

kernel/:
	The first long mode code
	Manages the long mode boot and initialises all the subsystems

pmm/:
	Manages physical memory allocaters

vmm/:
	Manages virtual memory allocaters
	Also contains kmalloc and kfree

The Memory Structure is this:

User Mapping: Different per process:

	00000000'00000000-00007FFF'FFFFFFFF: User mode (can be used for whatever by the user, should all be user mode permissable)

Kernel Mappings: Saved across procs:

	FFFF8880'00000000-FFFFC87F'FFFFFFFF: 64 TB Direct Physical Mapping

	FFFFFFFF'80000000-FFFFFFFF'FFFFFFFF: The Kernel (also the last PML4E)
